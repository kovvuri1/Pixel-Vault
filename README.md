This is a simple React application that allows users to search for images using the Pixabay API. The app consists of a search bar where users can input a query, and it fetches relevant images based on the input. It uses useState to manage the search query and fetched data, and useEffect to trigger an API call whenever the search input changes. The images are displayed in a responsive grid using map to dynamically render them. The project also includes basic error handling and custom components for the header and carousel.
